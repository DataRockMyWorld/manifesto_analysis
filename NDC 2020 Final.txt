1 INTRODUCTION
  

As Social Democrats, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) subscribes to a compassionate political philosophy that seeks to create opportunities for all to develop to their fullest potential. 
We believe that our pursuit of economic prosperity for all Ghanaians can best be achieved through appropriate regulation and strategic investments. The NDC is, therefore, committed to using the legal, fiscal and trade instruments at our disposal, in an inclusive effort, to safeguard the jobs of today and create sustainable jobs for the future. 
This Manifesto is our Social Contract between the people of Ghana and the NDC Government. Creating a bright future for Ghana and our people means delivering on our Social Contract and ensuring that the vision comes to life. 
In our quest to build a sustainable society with opportunities for all, we will continue to prioritise quality education and skills development as the cornerstone of progress. We will embark on a US$10 billion accelerated infrastructural plan, dubbed the ‘Big Push’, which will drive jobs and entrepreneurial agenda. 
We, in the NDC, re-dedicate ourselves to the expansion of economic freedom and opportunities by providing incentives for small businesses to grow, as well as, encourage local community development. In addition, we will build an environment for digital transformation and domestic manufacturing to support job creation. 
Our overarching goal is to deliver Jobs, Prosperity and More.  
To achieve this, John Dramani Mahama will focus on delivering on the following development priorities over the next four (4) years: 
•  Fixing the Economy and Uniting Against Poverty 
•  Promoting Human Development 
•  Providing Infrastructure for Accelerated Growth 
•  Creating Sustainable and Decent Jobs “Edwuma Pa” 
•  Promoting Good Governance, Anti-Corruption and Accountability 
•  Deepening International Relations and Foreign Affairs.

FOREWORD BY 
FLAGBEARER 2
  

I have had the unique privilege of providing leadership as President, stepping back, and being elected again to lead the National Democratic Congress (NDC) into the December 2020 elections. 
I have had the opportunity, during the period, to reflect soberly on the challenges and expectations of governance and the heavy burden of people’s hopes and aspirations that come with it. 
Ghana cannot afford to do things in the same old way. Survival and success for today and future generations require a much more urgent and, in some cases, painful change of prevailing economic and social relations. 
Ghana needs a new era of Social Justice: 
• it is time for renewal and gathering 
• it is time for greater self-reliance 
• it is time to close the wealth gap that divides our society  
• it is time to finally end intolerance and social discrimination against ethnic groups, religious groups, gender and age groups 
• it is time to end the repression of the media 
• it is time to unite and create opportunities for all – not just a few 
• it is time to do this democratically – with the full involvement of our people. 
The world is changing fast and in very fundamental ways. We must place Ghana in sync with the new developments taking place around the world in order to propel our economy into an advanced one. We must prepare Ghana to cope with the current global changes, and we must open new horizons and hope, to instil a new sense of purpose in our people, catching up on what we have missed while taking steps to enhance our growth. 
To achieve this, we must build a knowledge-based economy and move faster into the new world of smart manufacturing and digital services. This will not only generate growth, but also prosperity for all Ghanaians. We will create not only jobs, but sustainable and decent jobs, so that people can live dignified lives. 
With this in mind, we set out to develop the People’s Manifesto, a social contract between the NDC and the people of Ghana. To make our manifesto-writing process widely consultative and popular, we adopted a bottom-up approach. 
Inadditiontointernal consultationswithintheNDC,ourgrassrootsorgansengagedtheir communities and forwarded their expectations for inclusion.  
I was also privileged to hold town hall meetings with representatives of different socio-economic groupings. I sought to derive a consensus on what the next NDC Government must do, how we must do it, and what roles citizens want to play in our forward march. The idea was to distil this knowledge and commitment into our Manifesto.

THE PEOPLE’S MANIFESTO 
Our consultative process wasinterrupted by the COVID-19 Pandemic. We did not, however, abandon our objective. We continued, using technology and small group meetings, until our objectives were achieved. 
Six months later, the Pandemic is spreading even faster, and with more disruptive effect on our lives than Government anticipated. From all indications, COVID-19 will continue to plague the world for some time to come, but this People’s Manifesto lays the foundation for its tackling and the renewal of my resolve to deliver Jobs, Prosperity and More for all Ghanaians. 
I hope you will identify with the ideals of our People’s Manifesto, vote for me John Dramani Mahama, and engage us to improve our programme delivery. 
I believe that there are great times ahead for all of us. 
Let us all join hands to create the country that we all wish for.

MESSAGE FROM THE 
RUNNING MATE 3
  

Three months ago, the National Democratic Congress (NDC), through the visionary decision of our Flagbearer H.E. John Dramani Mahama, opened a new chapter in our Party’s leadership by endorsing me asthe first female Running Mate; a manifestation of the NDC’s belief in gender justice and inclusion. I express my gratitude to the Flagbearer, the Founder, the Council of Elders, Party Executives and all Comradesfor granting me the opportunity to contribute towards our Great NDC’s resounding victory in the December 7, 2020 elections. 
As a nation, it is a fact that our socio-economic conditions are fast deteriorating under the current New Patriotic Party administration. The country faces a grim socio-economic future. The economy isfast collapsing, nepotism and state capture have characterised our political economy. By the NPP’s action and inaction, we are experiencing high levels of insecurity, and safety is not even guaranteed or assured anymore. The NPP’s adherence to the rule of law is only a mirage. Our once highly valued educational system has been politicised and devalued. This is the reason why I am happy to join hands with our Flagbearer, John Dramani Mahama, to rescue this country on December 7, 2020.  
The gender balance in our leadership as a Party provides hope for our resounding victory. Itsignifies inclusive and participatory democracy, which prioritises the needs of all: the head porters (Kayayei), okada riders, market women, traders, farmers, seamstresses, tailors, hair dressers, beauticians, carpenters, masons, steel binders, car mechanics, fishermen, teachers, nurses, security persons, persons with disabilities and all others, irrespective of gender, religion, ethnicity, profession or geographical location. To maximise the benefits of this gender balance for our rescue mission, I call for the full participation of every member of OUR GREAT NDC PARTY. I urge you to be part of the victory process.  
Having worked closely with H.E. John Dramani Mahama as former Minister of Education, I know he is a man of vision, a leader we can trust, a public servant of integrity and a courageous leader who makes the right decisions in the national interest at all times. I pledge to apply myself diligently and to dedicate all my energies and intellect to ensure a resounding victory for the NDC and for our country, Ghana. With God on OUR SIDE, VICTORY IS OURS!

MESSAGE FROM THE 
NATIONAL CHAIRMAN 4
  

The National Democratic Congress is a social democratic Party and believes in an egalitarian society in which there is equal opportunity for all Ghanaians. Equal opportunity refers to the right to adequate and affordable health care, decent jobs, quality education irrespective of gender or creed, liberty to practice one’s religion and to engage in religious activities, and the freedom to pursue one’s economic interests. The Party, therefore, seeks to empower the powerless, free the oppressed, liberate the poor, assimilate the marginalised and extend equal dignity to the vulnerable members of the Ghanaian populace. 
Since 1992, the NDC has sought to achieve these objectives through the various administrations which the Ghanaian electorate has given the Party the opportunity to lead. We have endeavoured to significantly improve the living standards of Ghanaians in all sectors of our lives and provide opportunities for enhancing education, health and business. In the education sector, the immediate past NDC administration provided infrastructure for the expansion of Senior High Schools in all corners of the country. In health, the previous NDC administration provided unprecedented health infrastructure that served the country well in combatting the COVID-19 outbreak. 
The huge number of road projects, undertaken in the immediate past NDC Administration, and the extensive provisions laid out for the future, have enhanced economic activities and these will lead to improved accessibility to all parts of the country. In the energy sector, the NDC carried out infrastructural development that effectively ended ‘dumsor’. Today, if Ghanaians enjoy continuous electricity in their homes and businesses, it is due to the prudent extensive infrastructural investments undertaken by the last NDC Administration led by President John Dramani Mahama in the energy sector. The NDC has positively impacted the lives of the people of Ghana in every aspect of our lives. 
This Manifesto carries many of these ideas and includes many new projects and programmes which will make the lives of all Ghanaians better. From health to education, to agriculture to tourism, everyone will find new policies that will impact positively on their lives. We do recognise the devastating effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the lives of all our people. The educational system has been seriously disturbed, our health facilities have been tested to theirlimits, peoples’ businesses have been adversely affected and so have the incomes of many of our people – particularly those in the private and informal sectors. In this Manifesto, the NDC has laid out extensive plans for taking the country forward to a better position, not only to restore what Ghanaians have lost, but more importantly, to raise the living standards of every Ghanaian. 
This People’s Manifesto has been prepared with the ordinary man and woman on the street in mind. You will find the language simple and unambiguous; the policy proposals also are so simple that everybody can relate to them. The issues have been presented in thematic areas and we have provided a Table of Contents so you can easily find issues you are interested in. I invite you to take the time to read it and note the contents. It is a social contract the NDC is presenting to the people of this country; give us your mandate and hold us to strict account of the things you find in here. 
Vote for John Dramani Mahama for President and let us, together, move Ghana forward.

5 BUILDING A PANDEMIC-RESILIENT GHANA
The COVID-19 Pandemic has already made a tremendous impact on life in Ghana. It has exposed the deep weaknesses in our health care system and brought an inadequate system to its knees. We address the medical response to the Pandemic under our section on health. However, the SARS II Coronavirus and COVID-19 are not just “health” problems measured by reference to infections deaths and treatment costs. Viruses like SARS II Coronavirus fundamentally disrupt our social relations such that to survive, we must change our way of life.  
Viruses have been around for billions of years. They have played critical roles in the evolution and decline of different species over millions of years. Generally, species (or communities of species) that have come into contact with dangerous viruses can either adapt or become extinct.  
Humankind differs from other animal species because, in addition to biological evolution, we have learned how to evolve socially as communities. We are not immune to viral attacks - human communities have perished as a result of viral attacks. We are, however, more adaptable in responding to new viral attacks. We can analyse viruses scientifically. We can develop vaccines and remedies for viral diseases to contain them. Besides, we can learn different behaviours that make us less susceptible to viral diseases. 
The viral challenge in the 21st Century is significantly greater than at any time in history because of the actual ways in which we have developed. On the one hand, development has exposed us to more and more viruses as we, directly and indirectly, interfere with natural virus reservoirs. We are warming the climate. We are destroying forests. We are mining deep into the earth. We are melting polar ice caps. We are polluting oceans. We are consuming animal and plant species that have adapted to living with dangerous viruses that can jump species. On the other hand, we have massively increased the opportunities for viruses to spread within our species.  
Three hundred thousand years ago, humankind lived in communities of typically 22 adults and probably interacted with their nearest neighbours, not more than monthly. Viral infections could thus “burn” their way through specific communities withoutspreading to other communities. Today we live in a “global village” with mega-cities and tens of millions of inhabitants. Furthermore, there are millions and millions of individual trips between communities, countries and continents every day. In these conditions, Pandemics are almost inevitable. Thus, we must prepare for viruses that are far more dangerous in terms of their infection and mortality rates than the SARS II Coronavirus. 
Given these challenges, our responses must be scientific, organisational and cultural. They must cut across all sectors. They must cut across all levels of social organisations, from community and to the United Nations. Thus, they must be adaptive. We need comprehensive social change and reorganisation. Fortunately, this is precisely what social democrats, such as the NDC, have campaigned for over the decades. 
13 
THE PEOPLE’S MANIFESTO 
The current NPP Government’s response to the Pandemic has been characterised by: Callous indifference – NPP took weeks before focusing seriously on the problem as they continued to hold mass durbars in Kyebi and Kumasi when other countries were shutting down. Thus, the NPP prioritised its pursuit of power over lives by insisting on holding its internal elections and coronations over containing the disease in the last two months or forcing school children back into unsafe boarding environments before the GES was ready to manage admissions safely; 
Populism and propaganda – the NPP has focused on looking good rather than on dealing with the problem. For example, the NPP massaged COVID-19 statistics to create a false sense of security and the impression of leadership. Thus, the Director General of the Ghana Health Service (GHS) suspiciously announced that the infection had peaked in early April to justify the Government’s lifting of the lockdown or provide verbal instructions to doctors in the public health system not to perform autopsies on suspected COVID-19 patients to suppress statistics on mortality rates: 
Corruption – the NPP hasfailed to account for the billions and billionsthat have flowed into national coffers to support our fight against the Pandemic even as it is cutting back on mass testing and contact tracing, while it has sought to claim credit for the work of private individuals, e.g. around the lockdown feeding programme. 
These failings are squarely attributable to the wrong priorities of NPP leadership. However,there are deeper structural problems that we need to address. We all know that the most effective response to COVID-19, back in February and March was a lockdown. Our inability as a country to implement an effective lockdown in Accra, Kumasi and Kasoa for just 3 weeks demonstrated the collapse of our national political organisation. 
The State was unable to organise food supplies to the vulnerable in our communities – even as foodstuffs lay rotting on farms just a few hours away and farmers and transporters lost their livelihoods. Ghana’s attempts to feed the Urban poor led to stampedes by starving people that surely accelerated the spread of the virus in inner-city areas. The State also failed to protect the physically weak from deprivation by the physically strong. Our State could not organise the distribution of essential hygiene products to peoples’ homes. 
Our State was unable to police lockdowns (or even mask-wearing) without violent abuse of citizens’ constitutional rights. It is probable that, in subsequent waves of viral spread, we will have to lock down cities, Districts, Regions or the entire country. It is possible that at some point, we will have to ration essential supplies. Without addressing these problems, we will fail in the future just as we failed last March. It is clear that the NPP lacks the vision or the competence to design solutions to them. The NDC must and will confront these problems head-on. 
The next NDC Government will approach COVID-19 holistically as the principal framework for development planning through our social reorganisation project. From our first day in office, we will: 
a.  review every single MDA and Government programme and project, and every budget line in terms of how it affects our campaign to suppress infections and build resilience b.  actively shift resources from luxury spending to enable us to address COVID-19 in a scientific, planned, and sustainable way 
c.  prioritise expenditure on social safety nets and on supplies (e.g. PPE) for front-line workers (particularly front-line health workers, schools, teachers, etc.) and in the systems that ensure that these actually reach the intended targets
14 
THE PEOPLE’S MANIFESTO 
d.  call a national conference on pandemic resilient living within the first Quarter of 2021 to galvanise the country to meet ongoing and upcoming challenges in unity e.  improve coordination between MDAs and MMDAs based on the accelerated devolution of responsibilities to MMDAs. Within the MMDAs we will empower Assemblymen/ women and Unit Committees that work directly with communities 
f.  within the framework of our 2016 Land Use and Spatial Planning Act, implement a massive programme of spatial planning and urban renewal to achieve well-planned cities, towns and villages better able to meet pandemic challenges 
g.  support community self-organisation as provided for in Article 35(2)(a) of the Constitution to ensure that communities can direct Assembly organisations constructively to provide the specific solutions needed in communities 
h.  use COVID-19 resources (whether provided by Development Partners or from savings from our expenditure reviews) to ensure that defined processes are rapidly improved in an accountable and democratic way including: 
•  intensive education on the science and management of virus suppression including hand washing, sanitiser use, avoiding face touching etc. 
•  management and coordination of wholesale and retail trading to avoid crowding and minimise the level of physical interaction amongst citizens 
•  plan and manage relief supplies to vulnerable citizens at their residences to avoid the ugly scenes we saw during the lockdown and suppress transmissions; and 
•  arrange community-level policing of COVID-19 regimes.

Our ICT infrastructure programme prioritises increased access for connectivity at lower costs. It also has a district internet component that will allow both greater “physical” distancing and greater “social” engagement in all aspects of our lives – production, education, healthcare, entertainment.  
We are committed to a community-led vision of national development that will strengthen and upgrade, particularly, food supply-chains to make our communities more economically self organised, planned, and self-sufficient enabling them to directly manage social reorganisation to a more resilient way of living. This is what it takes to protect our communities and return to equitable growth in the shortest possible time.

FIXING THE ECONOMY AND 
UNITING AGAINST POVERTY 6
  

Ghanaians need new opportunities for the development of their talents and skills. Transitioning from the current economic model to a knowledge-based economy will provide exactly that. 
We will fight the deleterious effects of the poor economic management of the Akufo-Addo Government and change the economic model to unleash the creativity of every Ghanaian. 
The results of the current model during the last four years, at the micro-level, have been hardship, spiralling cost of living, high unemployment, massive job losses and a generally harsh economic climate.  
On the macro front, the mounting public debt, depreciating currency, and rising inflation above the failed NPP Government’s target, deteriorating balance of payment position and the current poor economic growth are tell-tale signs of an economy in deep distress. 
The NDC has the record and experience to turn around this dire economic situation in order to bring relief to the suffering masses of Ghana. Among others, prudent macroeconomic measures, anchored in sound management, will be rolled out. 
The public debt will be brought under control, inflation will be reduced to the barest minimum, and a low taxation regime instituted. Inclusive growth will be restored to appreciable levels, while the business environment will be made friendly again. 
The long-suffering Ghana Cedi will be stabilised and strengthened. The private sector will receive the biggest job-related stimulus package in Ghanaian history. 
The financial sector will be sanitised, and emphasis placed on growing Ghanaian participation in the economy. We will put an immediate end to the vindictive targeting and collapse of indigenous Ghanaian businesses and its attendant job losses. 
Job creation will be the predominant preoccupation of the next NDC Government as a way of enhancing the livelihoods of our people, under a One Million Jobs, EDWUMA PA Plan. 
There will be major annual recruitment of young Ghanaiansinto an expanded and productive public sector based on a carefully conducted Human Resource Gap Analysis. In addition, we will launch a National Apprenticeship Programme that will train technically skilled human resource, for rapid industrialisation, job creation and entrepreneurship. 
The NDC has done this before by ensuring the most stable and prosperous period of economic management during which the highest economic growth rates and the longest sustained period of single-digit inflation were recorded. The NDC will again generate economic growth that creates infrastructure and sustainable jobs. 
Drawing on this record, we will usher Ghana into an era of shared prosperity under which all Ghanaians reap the fruit of their labour and not a privileged few who carve out state resources for their exclusive benefit. 
19 
THE PEOPLE’S MANIFESTO 
We need to turn our beloved country, Ghana, into an advanced nation. The first step is to eradicate extreme poverty. We need to make sure that all Ghanaians are protected during the transition towards a fully modern Ghana! It is time to unite as one people, resume our journey towards building the future of Ghana. 
It is possible. This is the very ethos upon which the next NDC Government will be built – Social Justice and Equality.
  
20 
THE PEOPLE’S MANIFESTO 
6.1 FINANCE AND ECONOMY
  

In line with article 36(1) of the 1992 Constitution, the State is mandated to take all necessary measures to ensure that the national economy is managed in such a manner as to maximise the rate of economic development and to secure the maximum welfare, freedom and happiness of every Ghanaian. 
The next NDC Government will aggressively promote and protect indigenous Ghanaian businesses, to ensure greater Ghanaian ownership of the commanding heights of the economy,such as banking, insurance, construction, telecommunications, the extractive sector, energy, and international trade. The next NDC Government will also enhance the current environment for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). 
Local economic development (LED) will be the bedrock of our national development strategy. We will ensure that every district and community in Ghana participate fully in national development and benefits according to its local economic development. We shall collaborate with the private sector to establish agro-processing factories across the country based on regional comparative advantage. 
To promote private sector development andmake theGhanaian industry internationally competitive, and to protect consumer interests and safety, we will enact the National Competition Law and Consumer Protection Law, which will support the establishment of a Consumer Protection Council. 
Existing laws and policiesthat constrain the growth of the private sector will be reviewed, amended, or eliminated. We will continue to work with key stakeholders, such as the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI), the Private Enterprise Federation (PEF), the Ghana Union of Traders Associations (GUTA), and other identifiable groups like the market associations, mechanics, tailors and barbers to ensure greater private sector participation.  
6.1.1  Macro-Fiscal Policies 
Broad Macro-Fiscal Targets 
The broad macro-fiscal targets of the next NDC Government are: 
•  low levels of inflation that will translate into reduced lending and interest rates •  high levels of inclusive and sustainable GDP growth rates that will create and sustain high income earning jobs 
•  an overall budget deficit at sustainable levels using the primary balance as an anchor to ensure that Government financing needs do not crowd-out the private sector •  contain public debt within sustainable limits. 
Fiscal Policy Objectives 
The absence of fiscal space in 2021 will require significant effort by an NDC Government to navigate governance and administrative constraints in its financing. For example, debt service and compensation exceeded total domestic revenue by 55.7 per cent as at June 2020 (2020 Mid-year Budget Review). 
Therefore, the overall fiscal policy objectives of the NDC Government from 2021, in the medium term, will be guided by fiscal deficits that are consistent with the transformational agenda of the NDC Government and a primary balance that will keep the agenda on a sustainable path.  
21 
THE PEOPLE’S MANIFESTO 
Public expenditure in 2021 will be tailored towards investments that will lead to robust economic growth while promoting social inclusion - Social Justice. Debt financing will be directed to growth stimulating projects and programmes. Fiscal policy will be used as a tool to stimulate competitive business growth. 
The NDC acknowledges that every Ghanaian, including market women, taxi drivers, tro-tro drivers, ‘okada’ ‘prajia’ and ‘aboboya’ riders, farmers, fisherfolk, hairdressers, tailors,seamstresses, artisans, businessmen, businesswomen, entrepreneurs, civil servants, labourers, directly or indirectly participate in the Public Revenue Mobilization Process to contribute to the Resource Envelope. 
Therefore, the economy draws its strength from the activities of households, firms, businesses, and other relevant Government units. The fiscal policy of the NDC in 2021 will be designed to ensure that taxes are fair, equitable and favourable, and that public expenditure is aligned to the needs of Ghanaians. 
The NDC Government will focus primarily on eliminating the crowding-out of the Ghanaian private sector to create sustainable jobs, guarantee decent incomes, improve the livelihood of Ghanaians and bridge the inequality gap. 
Goals  
To achieve the goals of the fiscal policy the next NDC Government will: 
a.  realign the entire fiscal framework to achieve efficient resource mobilisation and utilisation of public funds 
b.  ensure fiscal stability using the fiscal balance as a primary anchor 
c.  enhance the Public Financial Management Act (PFMA) to develop secondary anchors and rules around revenue, expenditure, primary fiscal balance, borrowing and debt. 
Strategies 
The next NDC Government will: 
a.  broaden the tax base while containing tax rates 
b.  reduce discretionary tax exemptions 
c.  improve tax collection 
d.  rationalise expenditures 
e.  ensure a transparent relationship with stakeholders and investors. 
Focus of Revenue Policy and Strategies 
The principal objective is to ensure a stable tax system that does not distort production decisions and the distribution of income. The next NDC Government will implementthe following reformsthat will enhance revenue mobilisation while broadening the tax base and promoting business growth: 
a.  improve systems and processes including integration and interfacing of customs b.  integrate domestic tax database with other institutional databases  
c.  streamline GRA headquarters along functional lines 
d.  improve operations in domestic tax offices and customs’ entry points e.  revise income and corporate tax rates and review the system of financialsupport to the poor, vulnerable, and retirees.
22 
THE PEOPLE’S MANIFESTO 
Tax Measures 
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) contribute significantly to private sector development in Ghana. MSMEs in Ghana offer sustainable and meaningful jobs to the majority of Ghanaians. 
Many SMEs that cannot endure the harsh economic conditions following the mismanagement of the economy by the NPP Government and the deliberate collapse of businesses by same, coupled with the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, will be forced to lay-off most of their workers and at worse fold up, especially those that cannot keep up with production. 
Beginning 2021 and into the medium-term, the NDC Government will offer several tax reliefs to the private sector, especially MSMEs to enable them to recover and get back to their full operating capacities. The next NDC Government will ensure that firms leverage on these tax reliefs to expand their scope of production and employ more Ghanaians. 
Private Sector Tax Initiatives 
From 2021, MSMEs will be given tax reliefs to support their operations. Within the first three months of 2021, the NDC Government will lay before Parliament several bills that will seek to grant the following tax reliefs to MSMEs:  
a.  Tax Cuts for Jobs (effective 2021): 
•  small businesses will be exempted entirely from corporate and personal income tax 
•  corporate income tax for medium size companies will be reduced from the current 25per cent to 15per cent 
•  newly established medium-sized companies that employ up to twenty (20) staff will be exempted entirely from the payment of corporate income tax for one year  
•  newly established medium companies that employ more than twenty (20) staff will be exempted entirely from the payment of corporate income tax for two years  
b.  exempt commercial vehicles and other equipment imported into the country for commercial, industrial and agricultural purposes from import duty 
c.  review the Customs (Amendment) Act, 2020 (Act 1014) to scrap the law banning the importation ofsalvaged vehicles. This willsave the local automotive industry, especially Suame Magazine, Kokompe and Abossey Okai from collapse 
d.  encourage vehicle assembling companies to operate as a complement to local industry e.  reverse the decoupling of VAT (12.5 per cent), NHIL (2.5 per cent), GETFund (2.5 per cent), which has brought untold hardship to Ghanaian businesses and households. The NPP Government in 2018 effectively increased the VAT rate under the guise of decoupling the NHIL rate and the GETFund rate from the value-added tax system and made it a straight levy. Even though the statutory rate remained at 17.5 per cent after the decoupling, the effective rate increased from 17.5 per cent to 18.5 per cent because businesses were not allowed to claim their input VAT for the NHIL and GET 
Fund components of VAT. The NPP effectively introduced a tax through the backdoor f.  introduce a Rural Investor Incentive (RII) to create meaningful employment opportunities for the youth in rural areas. This is intended to address the adverse effects of rural-urban migration. Investors in rural communities: 
• will be exempted from dividend and capital gain tax 
•  employing up to fifty (50) persons will be granted tax exemptions and other incentives on the importation of capital equipment
23 
THE PEOPLE’S MANIFESTO 
g.  provide special tax incentives for indigenous value chain industries such as mineral processing, petroleum-based, agro-based, and pulp and paper industries, to unlock potential sustainable job opportunities. We will: 
•  use special tax incentives to maximise the gains from the value chain of indigenous manufacturing activities 
•  introduce the agriculture value chain tax incentives regime within the first quarter of 2021 
h.  introduce a Tax Support for Export Growth (TSEG) to address trade and balance of payment deficits and also in furtherance of the One Million Jobs Plan. Special tax incentives will be offered Ghanaian businesses in the Export-Oriented Industries (EOI) to stimulate exports 
i.  provide the Shipping Industry with special tax incentives to achieve Ghana’s objective of becoming a world-class cargo hub on the West African coast (similar to Singapore). For example, tax incentives, efficient logistics support, safety and security 
j.  revisit Ghana’s international tax policy to protect the tax base and profit shifting. We will: 
•  develop Ghana’s model tax treaty negotiating manual 
•  strengthen Ghana’s tax treaties to eliminate transfer pricing 
•  establish and equip a new Centre with expertsto specifically handle international tax-related issues. 
Fiscal Incentives for rent reform 
We will: 
a.  engage landlords, real estate investors and tenants to review the Rent Act to provide tax incentives to landlords and real estate investors to reduce the cost of rent advance for residential and commercial purposes 
b.  restructure rent control office into Ghana Rent Authority to effectively implement the new Rent Act in the interest of tenants and landlords. 
Expenditure Policies and Strategies  
The nextNDCGovernment will ensure thatGovernment expenditure policies are designed to contain fiscal deficits within sustainable levels consistent with Government growth strategies and policies. 
To eliminate the risk of fiscal unsustainability and its long-term implications on debt, the next NDC Government from 2021 through to the medium-term, will redirect Government expenditure towards high growth areas to create the necessary and sufficient conditions for social spending to thrive. 
Capital expenditure in the last three and a half (3½) years, under the NPP Government, has consistently remained below three percent (3%) of GDP. At this level, our economy cannot deliver the growth momentum required to restore us to economic prosperity and development. For the next NDC Government, the level of investment in the Real Sector will be our true measure of performance. 
The two (2) primary thematic areas of the next NDC Government will be centred on the following: a.  realign public expenditure to high growth-inducing areas while emphasising social protection policies such as free primary health care 
b.  institutionalise structural reformsin accordance with the Public Financial Management Act (PFMA) to enhance effective budget implementation, eliminate budget overruns and off-budget expenditures, and ensure value for money. 
24 
THE PEOPLE’S MANIFESTO 
Expenditure Measures 
The overarching aim of Government expenditure measures under the next NDC Government will be to ensure an inclusive, sustainable, and job-creating economic growth, alongside an effective and efficient public service delivery. The NPP Government since 2017 has deprived critical state institutions of the resources needed to execute their mandate effectively and efficiently. The next NDC Government will restore the much-needed resources to these critical state institutions. In this regard, we will pursue the following growth-oriented and job-creating expenditure measures: 
a.  implementthe‘BigPush’forInfrastructuralDevelopmentandEconomicTransformation. Capital expenditure has slowed down considerably in the last three and a half (3½) years, under the NPP Government. The impact of COVID-19 is expected to slow it down further. A Big Push is required to turn this around.  
  The next NDC Government will set up a $10 billion Fund to build robust infrastructure like roads, railways, port expansion, inland ports, hospitals, social housing and multi purpose markets in every part of the country. 
  A component of the Big Push is a transportation plan made up of three (3) major projects: the Eastern Corridor; the Golden Triangle; and the Western Corridor Project. 1.  The Eastern Corridor Project 
a.  Complete the Eastern Corridor Road  
b.  Port Infrastructure at Keta 
c.  Bridge over Oti River, Volivo to Dorfor Adidome bridge 
d.  Tema to Ho Highway 
2.  The Golden Triangle Railway: (Kintampo, Takoradi, Tema) 
•  Tema- Accra- Cape Coast- Takoradi 
•  Tema- Accra- Kumasi- Kintampo 
•  Takoradi- Kumasi- Kintampo  
a.  Three carriage way, inbound and outbound 
•  Accra-Kumasi-Kintampo 
•  Accra-Cape Coast-Takoradi 
•  Takoradi- Kumasi- Kintampo 
3.  Western Corridor 
a.  railway line from Sekondi-Takoradi to Axim, Elubo, Enchi, Asawinso, Goaso, Sunyani, Wenchi, Bamboi, Bole, Sawla, Wa, Nadowli, and Hamile 
b.  dual carriage road along the railway line from Sekondi-Takoradi to Axim, Elubo, Enchi, Asawinso, Goaso, Sunyani, Wenchi, Bamboi, Bole, Sawla, Wa, Nadowli and Hamile 
c. inland port at Hamile  
d.  expansion of Takoradi Port to Sekondi. 
b.  restore the transfer of 2.5 percentage points of existing VAT to the Ghana Infrastructure Investment Fund (GIIF). The GIIF was established by the John Mahama administration with the mandate to deliver infrastructure projectsin Ghana for national development. GIIF has the potential to create One Million Jobs along its value chain  
c.  increase the District Assembly Common Fund (DACF) allocation from 5 per cent to 7.5 per cent of Annual Total Revenue to enable the District Assemblies to function effectively and undertake activities that will spur economic growth at the local level. The NPP Government,since 2017, has continually starved the District Assemblies using the Earmarked Fund Capping and Realignment Policy 
d.  promote local content for local contractorsin allsectors of the economy to increase the contribution of Ghanaians to a minimum of 55 per cent of GDP and improve Ghanaian ownership and participation in the economy
25 
THE PEOPLE’S MANIFESTO 
e.  amend the Public Procurement Act to give priority to Ghanaian businessesin the award of contracts financed from public funds 
f.  Where the contracts are financed by foreign loans, the legislation will ensure that a significant portion goes to local companies.  
Public Debt and Financing Operations 
The unprecedented borrowing of the NPP Government in the last three and a half (3½) years has worsenedGhana’s public debtstock, increased its debtservicing andworsened its debtsustainability. 
The NPP Government has increased Ghana’s public debt from GH¢120.30 billion in 2016 to about GH¢258.4 billion as at end-June 2020. Under the NPP the public debt is projected to increase to GH¢290 billion by end-December 2020 (2020 Mid-Year Budget Review), with an addition of about GHC170 billion to the public debt stock in the last four years, with very little to show for it. 
The public debt stock as a share of GDP increased from 56.8 per cent in 2016 to 67 per cent as at end-June 2020 and projected at 75.8 per cent of the rebased GDP by end-December 2020. As a demonstration of the incompetence of the failed Akufo Addo Government and his economic management team, the public debt as a share of GDP deteriorated from 57 per cent to 67 per cent further within one and a half years between 2018 and June 2020. Debt service increased from GH¢16.13 billion in 2016 to a projected value of GH¢38.5 billion by end December 2020. 
Debt service as a share of domestic revenue increased from 51.9 per cent in 2016 to a projected value of 73.5 per cent by end December 2020, while debt service as a share of total expenditure increased from 32 per cent in 2016 to a projected value 39.4 per cent by end December 2020. 
The next NDC Government will adopt a number of financing strategies to manage Ghana’s public debt effectively. These will include: 
a.  strengthening the domestic borrowing market by enhancing the auction (treasury) and book building (bond) approaches that were introduced in 2015 
b.  enhancing external market borrowing strategies, including the use of the sinking fund as a tool for “buy-backs” and redemptions 
c.  using the EXIMBank as an agent for trade finance (credit and guarantee) in collaboration with other agencies such as Ghana Export Promotion Authority (GEPA), Ghana Standards Authority, AGI/Chamber of Commerce and Co-operatives 
d.  assigning the Debt Management Office at the Ministry of Finance to be in charge of issuing short-term (treasury bills and notes) and medium-term (bonds) fiscal instruments, once determined by the Budget Office

the health and education sectors 
m.  seeking highly concessional loans for social infrastructure and commercial loans for self-financing infrastructure 
n.  establishing a contract and project management register to ensure accountability and transparency.  
6.1.2  Monetary Policy 
The next NDC Government is committed to the 
overarching objective of maintaining low inflation and 
ensuring financial stability post-COVID-19. The COVID-19 
measures implemented to support the financial sector 
will have to be enhanced and extended if the pandemic 
persists.  
The questionable GH¢10 billion loan from the Bank 
of Ghana to the Government could pose challenges 
for liquidity management and monetary policy in the 
medium term. Also, the unjustifiable introduction of 
GH¢100 and GH¢200 denomination notes could have 
adverse impacts on the currency in circulation, money 
supply and inflation in the medium term. 
The next NDC Government will ensure that the Bank’s 
policies are first and foremost geared towards economic 
development, in addition to promoting price stability (low 
and stable inflation and exchange rates) and ensuring a 
sound and resilient financial sector. 
Among others, we will 
a.  strengthen monetary policy formulation and 
maintain low but adequate money growth to support 
financial intermediation and economic growth post 
COVID-19 
b.  enhance the application of the Ghana Reference 
Rate (GRR) in implementing monetary policy 
c.  ensure lower lending rates through a more 
appropriate pricing of risk for customers by the banks 
d.  manage the flexible exchange rate regime to 
facilitate adjustment to external shocks and ensure 
sustainable external buffers at all times 
e.  maintain well-aligned real effective exchange rates to support the competitiveness of our exports 
f.  lower Ghana’s elevated sovereign risk by reducing external financing and strengthen the current account position through export-promoting policies 
g.  improve the business environment and attract higher levels of non-debt, creating private capital inflows.

THE PEOPLE’S MANIFESTO 
6.1.3  Financial Sector Policy 
Financial stability, development and inclusion 
Under the previous NDC Government, a number of efforts were made to promote financial sector deepening and greater accessto financialservices by individuals. In particular, the NDC Government embarked on a programme to improve financial sector oversight with a wide range of institutional reforms and the passage of a number of new financial sector laws in 2016. These included: 
a.  the Bank of Ghana Amendment Act 2016 (Act 918) 
b.  the Banks and Specialized Deposit-taking Institutions (BSDI) Act 2016 (Act 930) c.  the Deposit Insurance (DI) Act 2016 (Act 931) 
d.  the Securities Industry Act, 2016, (Act 929) 
e.  recapitalise National Investment Bank and make it stronger to provide long term financing 
f.  establish a Financial Therapy Centre to support households in financial crises in collaboration with the School of Business, University of Cape Coast. 
The BSDI Act 2016 and the DI Act 2016 addressed a number of regulatory gaps,such as consolidated supervision, dealing with cross-border and cross-sector collaboration in banking. The D1 Act 2016 also provided a comprehensive framework for dealing with distressed banks. These laws also strengthened the central bank’s powers in licensing, dealing with illegal banking and providing a transparent procedure for regulatory issuances. 
It must be emphasised that these laws, which were passed under the NDC Government, were the very ones that provided a legal framework for the NPP’s financial sector exercise, but which was implemented wrongly. 
Following the severe energy and commodity price shocks which impacted on the banking industry, a.  an Assets Quality Review (AQR) exercise was launched in 2015 to ascertain the true State of health of banks in the industry 
b.  the Energy Sector Levy Act (ESLA), 2015 (Act 899) was passed by the NDC Government to, among others, help clear the energy sector debts, which were impacting negatively on the banks 
c.  the AQR exercise was updated in early 2016, and the results showed that banks were at various solvency levels 
d.  a recapitalisation and liquidity roadmap for the banking sector was established and the affected banks were requested in line with S.105(3) of the Banks and Specialized Deposit-taking Institutions (BSDI) Act 2016 (Act 930) to submit credible capital restoration plans with clear deadlines 
e.  a new minimum capital requirement of GH¢230 million for banks wasto be announced in early 2017 to be met by end-2019. This was much lower than the GH¢400 million subsequentlyadoptedby theNPPGovernmentwithout consultationswithstakeholders. 
Work was started to update the regulatory framework for banks with the passage, in the third quarter of 2016, of the Bank of Ghana Amendment Act 2016 (Act 918), the Banks and Specialized Deposit-Taking Institutions (BSDI) Act 2016 (Act 930) and the Deposit Insurance Act 2016 (Act 931). 
These provided a comprehensive framework for dealingwith distressed banks. TheNPPGovernment, however, adopted a wrong approach in their contrived financial sector clean-up. 
28 
THE PEOPLE’S MANIFESTO 
It must also be noted that the implementation of the Basle II/III accord and IFRS 9 were all started in 2016 and efforts were made to strengthen the supervisory processes of the Banking Supervision Department and enhance the Bank of Ghana’s prudential framework. 
The Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) was also introduced at the same time, and initial guidelines were issued to banks. ICAAP would assess a bank’s risks, detail how the bank intended to mitigate those risks and how much current and future capital would be needed. 
This approach, together with the implementation of Basle III (covering risk capital and liquidity standards) would have engineered the needed flexibility for small local banks to operate alongside big banks without compromising on solvency or compelling small local banks to carry a lot of capital beyond their needs. 
Clearly, this approach would have served better than the controversial Ghana Amalgamated Trust Ltd (GAT) model, the special purpose vehicle which has been set up by the NPP Government to ostensibly support selected indigenous banks. 
GAT lacks transparency, especially regarding its beneficial owners, the sources of its funding and the sleazy criteria for selection of banks. The next NDC Government will lift the veil on the true beneficial shareholders of the scheme and the source of its funding as well as the predatory bailout strategy that was used. 
As part of the roadmap, a plan was developed to restore SOE’s financial viability, including clearance of Government arrears to SOEs and Bulk Oil Distribution Companies (BDCs) after an audit and verification of the claims. This plan was finalised for implementation, including a complementary strategy to issue Government bonds to repay the impaired loans to the affected banks promptly. 
In sum,the banking sectorissues were handled by the NDC administration, with the view of ensuring a sound, stable, and resilient financial sector to support inclusive economic growth. 
Incontrast,theNPPdecidedtoadopt ahaphazardapproachwithawrong sequencingofinterventions and with no reference to the strategy that was in place under the previous NDC Government. There was no prior consideration for the level of interconnectedness across the industry and also the fact that one of the banks, in particular, was a Domestic Systemically Important Bank (DSIB) that needed to be handled in line with best practices. For such DSIBs, the first best solution would have been a stabilisation option that engenders the least cost. These considerations were absent, and hence the results are not surprising. 
The next NDC Government will:  
a.  within one year in office, pay the full amount due to every victim of the reckless handling of the financial sector clean up by the Akufo-Addo Government 
b.  within one year in office, pay cash to holders of zero-coupon bonds issued over five years  
c.  forge ahead with effortsto improve financial sector oversight and market transparency and discipline 
d.  set up a Financial Services Authority to regulate the financial services industry, protect consumers, and ensure fair competition in the financial services sector 
e.  implementfully the Basle III framework which comprisesrisk-based capital and liquidity standards to help mitigate the potential impact of future systemic crises, reduce the overall capital cost to banks, and positively impact the availability, price and volume of credit

Non-bank financial institutions(NBFIs) play importantrolesin the financialsystem. They complement the commercial banks by filling gaps in the scope of services. We will: 
a.  reorganise the Savings and Loans(S&Ls) industry to facilitate their complementary role in the provision of financial services 
b.  regulate S&Ls under a more flexible legal regime by revising Act 930 and the NBFI Act, 2008 Act 774, and ensure that capital levels correspond to permissible activities c.  allow NBFIsto clear chequesthrough the Ghana Integrated Payments System (GhIPSS).

We remain committed to making financial services accessible to a large segment of the population that has little or no access to financial services. We commit to provide synergy and integrate the informalsector into the formal financialsystem. This will not only create employment opportunities but also increase the productivity and household income of the economically active poor. 
We will:

6.1.6  Capital Markets 
The next NDC Government will take steps to restore normalcy and growth to the capital market. 
While the Securities Industry Act, 2016 (Act 929), which was promulgated by the previous NDC Government is still generally adequate for now, we will take additional steps to facilitate the growth of institutions in the capital markets generally. 
We will review the regulatory and legal framework to make it possible for Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs) to issue bonds on their own.  
Specifically, the next NDC will: 
a.  restore stability and growth in the capital market 
b.  develop a new Master Plan to guide progress over the next five (5) years c.  encourage the private sector to issue bonds on their own strength and based on the economic viability of proposed projects 
d.  build the capacity of the capital market and develop a charterforthe Ghana Investment and Securities Institute

f.  support Ghana Alternative Market to help SMEs raise long-term capital. 
6.2 INSURANCE SECTOR

The Insurance industry has an important role in the economic growth of a nation. One of its main contributions is in facilitating long-term resources as it offers potential avenues to manage and mitigate risk, which increases the long-term investment potential of an economy. 
We shall adopt a Risk-Based Minimum Capital approach for the industry whereby minimum capital will be linked to the risks an insurance company carries, instead of the current fixed minimum capital regime.

6.11.1  Priority National Crop Commodities 
The food security, cash and industrial crops development as envisaged by the national Food and Agricultural Sector Development Policy (FASDEP) will remain the defining framework for the development of the crops and livestock sectors in the short to medium term. Hence, all policy, programme and project objectives and activities will be targeted at increasing and sustaining the production and productivity of the various crops as follows: 
a.  cereal crops: maize, rice, sorghum and millet 
b.  starchy staples: yam, plantain, cassava, sweet potato and cocoyam 
c.  legumes: soya bean, groundnuts, beans 
d.  vegetables: tomato, pepper, okro 
e.  work with stakeholders to develop reliable markets for primary agricultural produce •  tree crops: cocoa, shea nut, oil palm, cashew and coconut

7.1 HEALTH FOR ALL

Every Ghanaian deserves quality, accessible and affordable health care – Health for All – Universal Health Coverage. In pursuit of Social Justice, the NDC has always initiated and contributed significantly over the years, to building a working health system for Ghanaians. 
There have been unprecedented developments in the health sector under the last NDC administration. These include: 
a.  development of codified conditions of service for doctors 
b.  provision of ultramodern medical equipment to health facilities 
c.  construction of new and the expansion of some existing facilities to improve easier access to quality healthcare across the country, for example, the University of Ghana MedicalCentre,theGreaterAccraRegional(Ridge)Hospital,theShaiOsudoku(Dodowa) Hospital, the Ga East (Kwabenya) hospital, and a string of completed polyclinics across the country 
d.  establishment of Nursing Training Colleges. 
These are just a few of the numerous strategic interventions the NDC has made towards providing quality health care for Ghanaians. We believe our past achievements are relevant in 2021 and beyond.  
The NPP Government has eroded the gains made in Ghana’s health care development by the NDC. To achieve the objective of providing preventive, quality and responsive health care for all Ghanaians, particularly the youth, women, the elderly and people with disability, Ghana needs to accelerate plans to deliver a resilient and adaptive health system. The country also needs to build a health system that motivates and adequately rewards current and yet-to-be-employed health workers. 
As part of our social contract with Ghanaians, the NDC plans to employ more health workers, introduce and implement an efficient and well-funded Free Primary Health Care programme to benefit all Ghanaians. We will introduce innovative change management practices, implement financing and digitalmechanisms,supportthe provision of assisted fertilisation forfamilies especially women, build on our solid record of providing health infrastructure and medical equipment, and establish more health training institutions. 
These are solemn promises, which we firmly believe will make Ghana attain the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3, which seeks to provide health for all Ghanaians. In this regard, the NDC’s health care programme will target Ghanaians of all ages:

THE PEOPLE’S MANIFESTO 
PROVIDING GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE 7.2 AND QUALITY EDUCATION

The NDC reaffirms its unwavering conviction to the cardinal role of education in moulding the human resource of our nation and shaping a progressive and transformative destiny. 
As a Social Democratic party, which puts people first, it is our firm belief that the human resource of our great nation is the most valuable asset. It is, therefore, our resolve that no child is left behind. We shall place emphasis on quality, access, affordability and relevance with our new approach to delivering education to all Ghanaians. 
The NDC is keenly aware of the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic and is, therefore, committed to providing a compliant and resilient education system. Hence, we will complement the current teaching and learning system by increasing the use of educational technologies. E-learning in all educational institutions will be a major priority. We will embark on an aggressive programme of retraining both instructors and learners. 
We will invest massively in attaining the three (3) Rs- Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic - at all levels with special emphasis on bridging the gap between private and public basic schools. Skills development, blended learning and the Internet of Things (IoTs) shall be at the heart of our modern educational reforms. 
We will boldly confront the vexed issue of legal and medical education and introduce far-reaching reforms, which will create more opportunities for the youth. This will be done by expanding access while ensuring that quality is not compromised. We will realign education with the medium to long term human resource development vision of the country. 
Furthermore, the next NDC Government will usher in a new dawn for teachers through restoring the dignity of teachers and make them integral partners in national policy reforms. The intimidation and harassment of teachers who speak out will cease forthwith. Improved teacher conditions of service, incentives and all-round availability of Teaching and Learning Materials (TLMs) will be a priority. We will deepen engagement with all schools through the community, unions and Parent Teacher Associations (PTA) for efficient running. 
The gains made by the previous NDC administration in quality outcomes, with all-time best performances in the Basic Education Certificate Examinations (BECE) and West African Secondary Schools Certificate Examinations (WASSCE) have been eroded. In addition, efforts at expanding access and decongesting, particularly,CommunityDay School projects, have largely been deliberately abandoned by the Akufo-Addo Government. 
As a result, without proper planning, the NPP introduced the Free Senior High School (SHS) Programme which was to come at no cost to parents, as promised. Unfortunately, it has rather increased the cost burden on some parents. Confronted with the challenge of lack of space due to abandoned Community Day Schools, this Government resorted to the double-track system that has brought untold inconvenience to students, teachers and parents and negatively impacted quality teaching and learning. 
We are committed to implementing a better and improved Free Secondary Education Programme and will consequently end the dreaded double-track system which has increased cost of SHS education for some parents. We will further work towards eliminating the unfavourable conditions that have caused deaths in secondary schools.
