Hi everyone !

In this session, i perform text analysis on the 2020 manifesto's of the two dominant political parties in my country, Ghana.

These are the

* New Patriotic Party - NPP
* National Democratic Congress - NDC

![Image 1](https://newsghana.com.gh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/NPP-NDC.jpg)

By using the tidytext package(Silge and Robinson 2016) and other tidy tools in R, i attempt to apply tidy principles to text mining.

The goal is to practice my NLP skills and at the same time discover interesting patterns & insights these documents may hold.

Lets go!!!


## **SETTING UP ENVIRONMENT**

```{r loading packages, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(tm)
library(quanteda)
library(wordcloud)
library(ggrepel)
```

## **IMPORTING DOCUMENTS & PRE-PROCESSING**

```{r Import, warning=FALSE}
## NPP

npp_2020 <- read_lines("NPP 2020 Final.txt") # Import NPP manifesto
npp_tidy <- tibble(text = npp_2020) # Converting to dataframe

# NDC
ndc_2020 <- read_lines("NDC 2020 Final.txt") # Import NDC Manifesto
ndc_tidy <- tibble(text = ndc_2020) # Converting to a data frame

#Tokenization

ndc_token <- ndc_tidy %>% unnest_tokens(word,text) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% filter(!str_detect(word,"[0-9]+"))

npp_token <-  npp_tidy %>% unnest_tokens(word,text) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% filter(!str_detect(word,"[0-9]+"))
```


## **COMBINING BOTH DOCUMENTS**
Joining the two tidy manifestos

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
manifesto_2020 <- bind_rows(mutate(ndc_token, party = "NDC"),
                       mutate(npp_token, party = "NPP")) %>% mutate(linenumber = row_number()) %>% 
  relocate(linenumber, .before = word)

manifesto_2020

# Most popular words used in the manifesto

manifesto_2020 %>% count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

## **IDENTIFYING WORDS UNIQUE TO EACH MANIFESTO**
By using term frequency_Inverse document frequency (tf-idf) \n
and wordcloud

```{r}
# Run a tf-idf to see the words unique to each party

manifesto_idf <- manifesto_2020 %>% count(word,party) %>% 
  bind_tf_idf(word,party,n) %>% arrange(desc(tf_idf))

# Plot of top 15 words unique to each party

manifesto_idf %>% mutate(word = as.factor(word)) %>% 
  group_by(party) %>% 
  slice_max(tf_idf, n = 10) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(word = reorder(word, tf_idf)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(tf_idf,word, fill = party)) +
  geom_col()+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#E063FF", "#63D8FF")) +
  facet_wrap(~party, scales = "free") + 
  theme (plot.caption = element_text(size = 13,
    face = "bold.italic", colour = "aliceblue"),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(linetype = "blank"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(linetype = "blank"),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 13, face = "bold",
        colour = NA), axis.text.y = element_text(colour = "antiquewhite"),
    legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gray0"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray0",
        colour = NA), legend.position = "none") +
  labs(caption = "Data from citionline | Graph by: Jewel Bansah") + theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(family = "mono",
    size = 12, colour = "darkseagreen1"),
    axis.text = element_text(hjust = 0.4,
        vjust = 0.4)) +labs(subtitle = "The NDC had more words centered around the people as their Manifesto title suggested") + theme(plot.caption = element_text(size = 11),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = NA),
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour = NA),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 11)) +labs(subtitle = "The NDC had more words centered around the people,/n the NPP focused on the economy") + theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 9),
    axis.text.y = element_text(colour = "aliceblue")) + theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11,
    face = "italic", colour = "aliceblue",
    hjust = 0.5), plot.title = element_text(face = "bold",
    colour = "aliceblue", hjust = 0.5)) +labs(title = "For the People vrs Leadership",
    subtitle = "Both Parties stuck to their core campaign message")
  

# Wordcloud 

# NDC 
manifesto_2020 %>% filter(party == "NDC") %>% 
  count(word) %>% 
  with(wordcloud(word,n,max.words = 100,scale = c(3.6,.25),colors = brewer.pal(8, "Set1"),
                 random.order = FALSE))

# NPP

manifesto_2020 %>% filter(party == "NPP") %>% 
  count(word) %>% 
  with(wordcloud(word,n,max.words = 100,scale = c(3.6,.25),colors = brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"),
                 random.order = FALSE))


```


## **SENTIMENT ANALYSIS** 
Gauging the mood (negative & positive) of both manifestos

# CHANGE OF SENTIMENT WITHIN THE MANIFESTO ----

## **SUMMARY** 


Coming into the 2020 elections in Ghana, the ruling NPP was hoping to win a second term while the opposition party, the NDC
was looking to topple them democratically.

Looking at the most popular words in both monifestos, the NDC appears to target the people (workers, gender, informal, care) while the NPP
looked to tout their accomplishments (stewardship, reduction, digitizing, depositors, delivered, promises). 
This is expected considering their respective positions in the election.

Sentiment analysis shows the NDC has more negative sentiments  throughout their manifesto compared to the NPP.
Again this is expected because the NDC is in opposition and would more likely focus on pointing out the short comings of the current government.
The NPP on the other hand will look to focus more on their achievement and promises of a better or more positive future.

Going into the elections, the most poular subjects were jobs, Covid and the financial sector cleanup amongst others.
It is therefore not surprising to see these and other related words by used by both parties at similar frequencies.
