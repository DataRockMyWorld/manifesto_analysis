(The party’s) policy is to liberate the energies of the  people for the growth of a property owning democracy  in this land, with right to life, freedom and justice, as the  principles to which the Government and laws of the land  should be dedicated in order specifically to enrich life,  property and liberty of each and every citizen.

PREFACE 
The New Patriotic Party (NPP), under the leadership of Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, is  presenting itself to Ghanaians to be re-elected to continue to lead this country for the next  four years, 2021-2025. We began this journey four years ago with the promise to rebuild this  country, fully aware of the numerous challenges that Ghanaians faced.  
In our 2016 Manifesto, we presented to Ghanaians our determination to tackle these numerous  challenges. We shared an inspiring vision to build a Ghana Beyond Aid. Rebuilding seemed an  impossible task. There were doubts in the minds of many about our ability to overcome the  challenges. 
In the course of our first term in office, we have made what seemed impossible a reality. With skill  and experience, we have brought the Black Star to its fitting status in the comity of nations. The  President’s vision of Ghana Beyond Aid has ignited the imagination of Ghanaians. With speed,  we have made significant progress in restoring economic stability, improved macroeconomic  conditions that affect the lives of Ghanaians and the successes of businesses, stimulating  growth, and providing opportunities for job creation led by the private sector, supported by a  much improved and stable banking system. We were on schedule to maintaining our momentum  for progress before the Coronavirus pandemic’s (COVID-19) major disruptions in every aspect  of our national life occurred, including the tragic loss of lives.  
Managing the disruptions, mobilising resources, protecting citizens from a ravaging virus, and  making sure that our progress is not derailed, have been the focus of the President, Nana  Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and his Government. And it is not hard to see why Ghanaians are  investing even greater trust in his leadership.  
We present to you, first, what we have delivered, and are delivering on the promises we made  to you, and second, to ask, once again, humbly, for your mandate for the next four years so we  can continue building on, and completing the work that we, together, have started.

MESSAGE FROM  
THE PRESIDENT 
We, in the New Patriotic Party, fully understand the consequence of putting a signature to a  contract. In 2016, we presented our Manifesto, titled “Change: An Agenda for Jobs; Creating  Prosperity and Equal Opportunity For All” to the Ghanaian people. It represented a solemn  social contract between the electorate and us, on the basis of which, by the grace of God and  the generosity of the Ghanaian people, we secured a famous and overwhelming victory.  
In that contract, we pledged, amongst others, to help create a society of opportunities for  all, we remained committed to our belief in democratic governance and private sector-led  economic development, and we reiterated our firm stance as the party of the rule of law, the  party of business, the party that builds and creates wealth, and the party of social justice. 
In the nearly four years that it has been my abiding privilege, by the grace of God, to lead this  party in government, we have kept our eyes firmly on these beliefs, and we have recorded  successes in all sectors of national life, which have had significant impact on the lives of all  Ghanaians. By common consent, it has been established that we have kept faith with the  people of Ghana, by fulfilling the great majority of our manifesto promises.  
We have changed the outlook on education in this country; we have revived and strengthened  our healthcare delivery system; we have been busy in the delivery of physical infrastructure  in all parts of the country; we have made huge investments in agriculture, with the goal of  ensuring our nation’s food security; we have cleaned the financial sector mess we inherited,  and have, with the active co-operation of the Bank of Ghana, strengthened the banking and  financial sector; and we have shown that the economy of our country can be transformed and  diversified by a government of the New Patriotic Party.  
We have embraced the application of digital technology in the delivery of public services;  we have restored the allowances of nursing and teacher trainees, that were scrapped by the  Mahama government; we have provided each constituency with an ambulance, a unique  achievement in Ghana’s history; we have reduced the benchmark values of import duties by as  much as 50%, and, in the case of vehicles, by 30%; we have put an end to the Unemployed  Graduates Association, which was such a sad feature of the Mahama years, by creating Nation  Builders Corps (NABCO) and several other job creation initiatives targeted at the youth; we  have systematically enhanced the capacity of the anti-corruption institutions of the State;  and we have superintended over the successful reorganisation of our regional governance  structure, resulting in the creation of six (6) new regions, with strong popular support.  
Indeed, all our flagship programmes, be it Free SHS, “One District, One Factory”, “One Village,  One Dam,” the Programme for Planting for Food and Jobs, et al, have been rooted in the effort  to liberate the energies of the people to grow an economy of which all the people can be part. 
On the global stage, the image and reputation of our country, which had been compromised,  are now high again.

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT
When the Coronavirus pandemic, that has wrought havoc to the lives and livelihoods of people  in all the nations of the world, reared its head in Ghana, we took immediate, decisive actions  to contain and limit its spread, and protect the population, actions from which the nation is still  benefitting, and, subsequently, took the equally bold decision to implement a Relief, Resilience  and Recovery plan, with the overarching aim of providing relief to the ordinary Ghanaian, and  being able to find more resources to strengthen the productive sectors of the economy to  ensure sustained economic activity. Government has gone ahead to establish the one hundred  billion cedi Ghana COVID Alleviation and Revitalisation of Enterprises programme, (we call it,  fittingly, the Ghana CARES programme), whose aim, over the next three years, is to stabilise,  revitalise and transform our nation, through the improvement of the country’s business climate,  and support for the private sector.  
Having achieved all these significant milestones, even in the midst of the difficulties we met,  and the negative effects of the unforeseen pandemic, I am hopeful that the Ghanaian people  would grant the NPP another resounding victory in 2020.  
That is why, in furtherance of this, the programmes and policies contained in the NPP 2020  Manifesto, dubbed “Leadership of Service: Protecting our Progress, Transforming Ghana  for All”, are aimed at consolidating the significant gains chalked in office, and setting the stage  for the next level of our nation’s development. I believe in the programmes that we have drawn  up in our Manifesto, because they will continue the nation on the path of social and economic  transformation, on which we have embarked. Indeed, they will lead to the transformation of  Ghana to the benefit of all Ghanaians.  
We must, however, be reminded, at all times, that we are up against an opponent who is  desperate to return to power to continue the agenda of mismanaging the economy to the  suffering and despair of businesses, households and families and, by that, jeopardising the  future of our children. We cannot afford to let that happen. We cannot, therefore, be complacent.  We have to work hard for victory, regardless of the fact that ‘One Good Term Deserves Another’.  
So, let us make sure our message is heard loud and clear from Axim to Aflao, and from Accra  to Paga. Let us go to every part of the country and spread the story of our good news; tell the  young people about the possibilities Free SHS will present them; tell the farmers about the  programme for Planting for Food and Jobs, which translates into enhanced income levels for  them; and let us tell the business entrepreneurs about the reduction of their tax burdens and  the improvement of the business climate, so their businesses can flourish, and they can, in  turn, create jobs.  
Indeed, the December 2020 presidential election represents, arguably, the clearest of choices  ever for the Ghanaian people to make.  
It bears repeating that 2020 is between the current President and the President who was voted  out decisively in the last contest. It is about leadership. It is about integrity. It is about the  performances of the two men when given the opportunity by the Ghanaian people to lead. It is  about measuring records against promises. It is about which of the two leaders has shown in  office that he knows how to manage the economy. It is about which of the two leaders you, the  voter, can trust to deliver. It is about which of the two men you can trust with the future of your  children. It is about which of the two leaders you know you can depend on in times of crisis.  It is about which of the two leaders you believe can put in motion the necessary measures to  revive and strengthen the economy, businesses, and social services, and build our country out  
viii NEW PATRIOTIC PARTY (NPP) • 2020 MANIFESTO 
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT
of the Coronavirus pandemic. It is about which of the two leaders can implement a programme  of transformation. 
We, in the NPP, have demonstrated that, with the support of the Ghanaian people, we are  capable of supervising the transformation of our economy and nation that all Ghanaians want.  I am confident that, together, all of us in Ghana, with the appropriate leadership, can fulfill the  dreams and aspirations of our forebears, who initiated the struggle for our nation’s liberation  and independence from colonial rule, and who envisioned Ghana to be a united, democratic,  prosperous and happy nation, the beacon of freedom and justice in Africa and the world. 
Four more years for Nana and the NPP to do more for you! 
The Battle is still the Lord’s!!

MESSAGE FROM  
THE VICE PRESIDENT 
Four years ago, at the launch of our manifesto, we promised Ghanaians that the next New  Patriotic Party (NPP) government will place people at the centre of its policies and programmes.  That the hopes, dreams and concerns of every Ghanaian will be the catalyst and guiding  principle in our quest to make life better for all.  
Four years on, I am proud to say that we have delivered on most of our promises and are  on course to deliver the rest, with the prayers and help of every Ghanaian, and under the  distinguished and able leadership of President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo. 
On assumption of office on 7th January 2017, we met a nation afflicted with a myriad of economic  difficulties, unprecedented unemployment, and a private sector in distress, but after three and  a half years of prudent management of the economy under President Akufo-Addo, we have  reversed largely the damage done by our predecessors. 
Despite the debilitating effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have stayed true to the social  compact we signed with Ghanaians to make life better for everyone. Our interventions in every  strata of society, in line with our policies and programmes, have been aimed at ensuring the  greater good.  
We of the New Patriotic Party are committed to initiating pro-poor policies and programmes to  bridge the inequality gap. The NPP has distinguished itself as the best Party to lead the forward  march for Ghana’s accelerated development.  
But, we are not just building infrastructure and introducing epoch-making interventions; we are  building a nation.  
We have been committed to our social contract to providing free Senior High School education,  creating jobs, transforming agriculture, industrialising the economy, sustaining the National  Health Insurance Scheme, digitising the economy, ensuring the public safety of Ghanaians,  and keeping the lights on. We still have much more to do. 
The future is bright if we stay the course. That is why we are asking the good people of Ghana  to give Nana Akufo-Addo and the NPP “four more to do more for you!” 
May God bless us all. 
May God bless our homeland Ghana.

MESSAGE FROM 
THE CHAIRMAN 
On the eve of the momentous 2016 Elections, Ghana was  
at a crossroad. We found ourselves in a messy economic  
and social crisis due to the mismanagement, incompetence  
and corruption of the Mahama-led NDC government. 
We asked for your mandate, and you elected overwhelmingly  
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo as president of Ghana. 
Four years on, we have kept faith with the people of Ghana.  
Under the presidency of Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,  
Ghana is on the rise again, we are on the right path towards  
economic prosperity, and have undertaken far-reaching  
institutional reforms necessary for good and accountable  
governance in a stable and democratic society. 
We have delivered on at least 80% of our promises,  
including Free SHS and TVET, “One District, One Factory”,  
on infrastructure development through Infrastructure for  
Poverty Eradication Programme (IPEP), and on “Planting  
for Food and Jobs” among many others. 
When, unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic struck, we steered the ship of state under the  competent leadership of President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, and secured largely the  health and safety of Ghanaians. 
As we head into another election in December this year, Ghana needs a stable, firm, and  competent leader’s hands over the next few years to ensure we protect the progress we have  made together, and to transform Ghana for all Ghanaians. 
I present to you Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, as the proven leader, a stable, firm, and  competent captain of the ship of state we need over the challenging years ahead, and I humbly  call on all Ghanaians of every stripe to, once again, overwhelmingly vote for, and renew his  mandate and that of our Parliamentary Candidates in December 2020. 
May God bless our homeland Ghana and continue to make us great and strong. Thank you.

PART 1: ACCOUNTING FOR OUR STEWARDSHIP
1. Promises Made, Promises Delivered 
The NPP, under the leadership of Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, is presenting itself to  Ghanaians to be re-elected to continue to lead this country for the next four years. We began  this journey four years ago when you gave us the overwhelming mandate in December 2016 to  lead the rebuilding of this country. We were aware of the monumental challenges that Ghanaians  faced, including:  
• declining economic growth 
• high and constantly rising inflation and interest rates 
• rapidly depreciating currency  
• low investor and business confidence 
• high unemployment, especially among the youth 
• poorly regulated and poorly managed financial services sector  
• a collapsing National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) and re-emergence of the cash and-carry system  
• a collapsing emergency healthcare system, with only 55 semi-functional ambulances in  the country 
• five years of disrupted electricity supply (Dumsor) with its associated costs • average annual increase in electricity prices of 45% between 2010 and 2015 • increases in taxes on many items that hurt production and penalise consumers • freeze on public sector recruitment 
• termination of teachers and nursing training allowances 
• teachers’ salary arrears (paid only 3 months) after working for 2-3 years 
• cumbersome process and corrupt practices associated with the acquisition of passports,  drivers’ licenses, as well as other government services, and 
• widespread corruption in public office 
In our 2016 Manifesto, we presented to Ghanaians our resolve to tackle these and other  daunting challenges. We shared an inspiring vision to create jobs and to build a prosperous  and inclusive society. Rebuilding seemed an impossible task. There were doubts in the minds  of many about our ability to overcome the enormous challenges we inherited let alone moving  forward the aspirations of citizens to improve their well-being and laying the foundations for  a Ghana Beyond Aid. What we had in abundance was the resolve to build a stronger, more  united and more prosperous nation, and that, with good governance and sound economic  management, and by the grace of God, we could make what seemed impossible possible.  
In the three and a half years we have been in office, we have stabilised the economy, eliminated  and reduced the number of taxes, reduced the overall tax burden, doubled growth, created  over two million jobs in the public and formal private sectors (inclusive of Government job creation programmes and initiatives such as Planting for Food and Jobs), improved access  to government services through rapid digitisation, and set millions of Ghanaians on the path

towards growth, prosperity, and equal opportunity through signature programmes like Free  Senior High School, Planting for Food and Jobs, One District-One Factory, and Infrastructure  for Poverty Eradication Programme. We have kept faith with the promises we made to the  Ghanaian people, and we have delivered or are delivering 80% of our manifesto promises.  
In the inspiring words of President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo: 
“it is my firm conviction that we can, and should, make this beautiful country of ours  more prosperous and improve the quality of life of every Ghanaian…Indeed we can, and  should, build a Ghana that is prosperous enough to stand on her own two feet: a Ghana  that is beyond dependence on the charity of others to cater for the needs of her people…”  
Here are highlights of over five hundred (500+) different activities, categorised under two  hundred and eighty-nine promises (289), we have, with the support of the Ghanaian people,  achieved so far in our first term (a detailed list of the status of our manifesto promises can be  found at www.deliverytracker.gov.gh):

• inflation dropped steadily from the high of 15.4%  at the end of 2016 to 7.9% (rebased) at the end of  December 2019, about the lowest recorded since  1992  
• for the first time in over 20 years, the Trade Balance  recorded a progressively large surplus in 2017,  2018, and 2019 
• between 2017 and 2019, the Cedi exchange rate  has been twice as stable as it was under the  Mahama-led NDC government (2013-2016): an  average depreciation of 8.7% under NPP and 18%  under the NDC  
• Ghana successfully issued the longest-dated, and  lowest priced Eurobond by a Sub-Saharan African  country. It was also oversubscribed by 350% 
• in real terms, the average real growth before 2017  (2014 to 2016) was 2.8%, while from 2017 (2017 to  2019) it was 6.96% 
• growth in 2017 was 8.4%, 6.2% in 2018 and 6.5%  in 2019, amongst some of the fastest growing  economies in the world for the last three years

1.2. Cleaning Up The  
Financial Services  
Sector Mess 
13 
PART 1: ACCOUNTING FOR OUR STEWARDSHIP
The NPP inherited a weak and fragile financial services sector from the Mahama-led NDC  Government. 
Many financial institutions had either collapsed or were on the verge of collapse. Many were  not paying their depositors or employees at all or regularly: There were countless instances  where customers made long journeys to withdraw as little as GH¢200 only to be asked to come  another day.  
These failures were a direct result of a system of poor licensing and regulation, non-existent  capital, weak corporate governance characterised by related-party transactions, and political  influence-peddling among others. Many innocent people – depositors, investors and employees  – suffered the consequences of these grievous lapses.  
The Mahama-led NDC Government and the management it put in place at the Bank of Ghana,  as well as at the Securities and Exchange Commission, had enough time to address these  failures, but failed to take action. Bank of Ghana was, for example, aware of the impending  failures in 2015, in the case of banks, and as far back as 2012, in the case of savings and loans  and micro finance companies. 
In order to clean up and strengthen the sector and prevent its collapse, the new management of  Bank of Ghana, which we installed, revoked the licenses of 9 banks, 23 savings and loans and  386 microfinance companies. The central bank did this to protect the entire financial system,  and preserve the hard-earned savings of hardworking men and women across the country.  
The Securities and Exchange Commission also revoked the licences of 53 fund managers for  the same reasons. 
The clean-up exercise, and the Government’s decision to step in to provide financial support,  ensured an orderly exit of the failed institutions, so that over 4.6 million depositors have access  to their deposits, and 81,700 investors to their investments, and, over 10,000 jobs saved to  date.  
The financial support, provided by the Akufo-Addo Government, ensured no depositor would  lose a pesewa of their savings. All depositors of the banks, savings and loans, and microfinance  institutions, by the end of September this year, would have received a full, 100% refund of their  deposits.  
Employees, whose salaries and benefits had remained unpaid by the defunct institutions, have  now been paid or are being paid by the Receivers. The alternative would have been millions of  depositors losing their savings and over 10,000 individuals losing their jobs.  
As at the end of the first quarter of 2020, a total amount of GH¢13.6 billion has been spent on  the resolution of failed banks, Specialised Deposit-taking Institutions (SDIs), Micro Finance  Institutions (MFIs), the establishment of the Consolidated Bank Ghana Limited (CBG), as well  as the capitalisation of the Ghana Amalgamated Trust (GAT).  
Additionally, with the President’s directives to pay fully all depositors whose funds were locked  up with the failed SDIs and MFIs, an amount of GH¢5 billion was spent. This brings the total  expenditure on financial sector interventions as at June 2020 to GH¢18.6 billion. Government  has also committed an amount of GH¢3.1 billion towards supporting investors in failed asset  management companies regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
14 NEW PATRIOTIC PARTY (NPP) • 2020 MANIFESTO 
PART 1: ACCOUNTING FOR OUR STEWARDSHIP 
This would bring the overall total Government expenditure for the failed financial institutions to  GH¢21.60 billion 
Furthermore, the nine indigenous banks, that were closed, were to a large extent taken over by  other indigenous Ghanaian banks – GCB and CBG – ensuring stronger Ghanaian ownership in  the banking sector. GAT, with 100% Government of Ghana ownership, has also successfully  invested in 4 indigenous banks to help them meet the new capital requirements.  
With GAT, Government saved over 5,400 direct and 12,000 indirect jobs, and ensured that the  country retained nine indigenous banks instead of only four, after the increase in the minimum  capital requirement for the banking industry. The transformational plan, being executed by GAT  and the investee banks, will have a significant positive impact on these banks and the economy  as a whole. 
The benefits of the clean-up exercise, including other regulatory reforms such as Bank  of Ghana’s Corporate Governance Directive (December, 2018) and Fit and Proper Persons  Directive (July 2019), are evident for all to see: we now have a stronger and more resilient  banking sector than we have ever had, and deposits in the banking system have increased  significantly as customers’ confidence in the system has rebounded.
